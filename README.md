# GoPro-Calibration-Distortion-Removal
This project uses Python and OpenCV to calculate the lens distortion of a GoPro.
This information is then used to remove the distortion from GoPro images and videos.

The main calibration program is GoPro_calib_web.py.  Once the distortion parameters have been calculated, distortion from
videos can be removed using Undistort.py.

For more information on how the script works and it's execution go to:
